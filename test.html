<p>Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Not if I weaken first.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The unexpected is our normal routine. and attack the Romulans. We have a saboteur aboard. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Sorry, Data. They were just sucked into space. Ensign Babyface! Your head is not an artifact! Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Sure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Computer, lights up! When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Travel time to the nearest starbase? I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. Computer, belay that order. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister.&nbsp;</p>
